On June 10, I am joining #ShutDownAcademia and #ShutDownSTEM strike in support
of Black Lives Matter. In observation of this strike, I will be dedicating my
time to join an anti-racism hackathon, hosted by UConn's SLAC and NBL
communities. I will also contact my legislators to advocate for critical systemic
change.

We must *each* take action to break down systemic racism, end anti-Black violence,
and support Black voices in all areas, including STEM and academia. I urge you
to join this effort---not just on June 10 but continually and in every way that
you can. To find out more about what you can do, visit #ShutDownStem's website
([link](https://www.shutdownstem.com/)), and then share your plans with others.
